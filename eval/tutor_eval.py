SumDeTing tutor prompt eval.

Sends a set of fixed conversations to the deployed tutor API and prints each
reply next to its pass-criteria, so a prompt change can be scored before it
goes in front of students. Run it AFTER deploying a prompt change:

    python3 eval/tutor_eval.py                 # prod endpoint (default)
    BASE_URL=https://staging.example python3 eval/tutor_eval.py

Judging is by reading (the tutor reply is non-deterministic, so there is no
exact-match assertion): a case PASSES only if every point in its CRITERION
holds. Paste the output into an LLM judge if you want it automated.

Why it hits the live API rather than Bedrock directly: the tutor's system
prompt lives in the deployed Lambda, and only the Lambda's role has Bedrock
model access. Requests are signed with x-amz-content-sha256 (the SHA-256 of
the JSON body), exactly as the browser does — required by the CloudFront OAC
-> Lambda Function URL path.

The reference problem below has final answer x = 10.
